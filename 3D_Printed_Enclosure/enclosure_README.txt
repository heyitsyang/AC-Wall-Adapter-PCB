This direcory contains the necessary files to 3D print an enclosure for the AC Adapter PCB.

Bottom.stl - bottom side of the enclosure - use for either the flat or tented top
Top_Enc_Flat.stl - flat enclosure top - choose either the flat or tented enclosure top option
Top_Enc_Tented.stl - tented enclosure top - choose either the flat or tented enclosure top option
AC_Plug_Shim.stl - spacer between plug and PCB - (see spacer_ship_placement.pdf)
AiO_IoT_AC_Wall_Adapter_Small_PCB_v1.0_Enc.f3d - Fusion360 design file

Notes regarding the Fusion360 design file:
 - the enclosure design is parametric in X,Y & Z directions
 - names of adjustable parameters are indicated in ALL_CAPS
 - adjusting parameters with lower case names yeild unexpected results
 
Other:
- enclosure halves are attached using #4 0.5 inch or M3 screws
